# Real-time Synchronization Update

## Changes Summary

### 1. Nickname System ✅
- **Added nickname modal** before entering room (both host and player)
- **Validation**: 2-20 characters required
- **User flow**: 
  - Host: Create Room → Enter Nickname → Initialize Room
  - Player: Join Room → Enter Nickname → Join Room

### 2. Real-time Player List Synchronization ✅
- **Dynamic player list updates** when players join/leave
- **Ready status synchronization** - when player clicks READY, host sees it immediately
- **Automatic UI updates** for all connected clients

### 3. Real-time Settings Synchronization ✅
- **Host changes settings** → All players see updates immediately
- **Settings types**: difficulty, language, time limit, rounds, spectator mode
- **Read-only for players** - players can see but cannot modify settings

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (`roomhost.html`)

#### Nickname Modal
```javascript
// Shows modal before entering room
showNicknameModal(callback) {
  // Validates 2-20 characters
  // Calls callback with username on confirmation
}
```

#### Socket Event Listeners
```javascript
// Listen for player joins
socketClient.on('player-joined', (data) => {
  updatePlayerList(data.players);
});

// Listen for player leaves
socketClient.on('player-left', (data) => {
  updatePlayerList(data.players);
});

// Listen for ready status updates
socketClient.on('player-ready-update', (data) => {
  updatePlayerList(data.players);
});

// Listen for settings changes (player side)
socketClient.on('settings-updated', (data) => {
  // Update UI with new settings
});

// Listen for full room state
socketClient.on('room-state', (data) => {
  updatePlayerList(data.players);
  // Update settings if player
});
```

#### Dynamic Player List
```javascript
function updatePlayerList(players) {
  // Clear and rebuild <tbody>
  // Show username, ready status, host badge
  // Update "waiting for X players" text
}
```

### Backend Changes (`server.js`)

#### Player Ready Event Handler
```javascript
socket.on("player-ready", ({ roomCode, ready }) => {
  // Update player ready status
  // Broadcast to all players in room
  io.to(roomCode).emit("player-ready-update", { players });
});
```

#### Enhanced Join Room
```javascript
socket.on("join-room", ({ roomCode, username, role }) => {
  // Add player with ready: false (or true if host)
  // Emit room-state to joining player
  // Broadcast player-joined to all others
});
```

#### Enhanced Settings Update
```javascript
socket.on("update-settings", ({ roomCode, settings }) => {
  // Broadcast to all players
  io.to(roomCode).emit("settings-updated", { settings });
});
```

#### Enhanced Disconnect
```javascript
socket.on("disconnect", () => {
  // Remove player from room
  // Broadcast player-left with updated player list
});
```
