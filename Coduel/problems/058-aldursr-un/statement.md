It is well known that there is no job more important than
being a mother. You, a proud mother, want to snap a photo of
your children to share on social media. But order is important
to you. You want the age of adjacent children to have a common
divisor greater than one. A common divisor of two numbers is
any number that divides both numbers without remainder.

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer 3 ≤ n ≤ 8 . The next line of
the input contains n integers, 1 ≤ c_ i ≤
10^9 . The integer c_
i describes the age of your i -th child.

## Output
The first line of the output should contain the ages of your
children after they have been rearranged to fit the criterion
above. If there are multiple valid rearrangements, print any of
them. If no such rearrangement exists, print ,, Neibb ”.
