You think you can code? This problem will test you on various basic programming
techniques. You are given two integers N and t ; and then an array A of N integers ( 0 -based indexing). Based on the value of t ,
you will perform an action on A .

## Input
The first line of the input contains an integer N and t ( 3
≤ N ≤ 200 000 ; 1
≤ t ≤ 7 ). The second line of the input contains N non-negative 32 -bit signed integers.

## Output
For each test case, output the required answer based on the
value of t .

## Scoring
There are 20 hidden
test cases that test various requirements of this problem. All 20 test cases will
be tested. Each hidden test case worth 5 points (the 7 sample test cases below worth 0 point).
