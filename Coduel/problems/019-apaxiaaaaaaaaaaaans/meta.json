  "description": "The ancient and mysterious Apaxian civilization, which we\nmost certainly did not make up, continues to confound the\nresearchers at the Oriental Institute. It turns out that the\nApaxians had a peculiar naming system: the more letters in your\nname, the higher your status in society. So, in Apaxian\nsociety, robert was probably a lowly\nservant, and robertapalaxiamethostenes was likely a High\nPriest or Minister. Even more than that, Apaxians valued the\nnumber of adjacent letters that were the same in a name. So,\nwhile robert continues to be an\nunimpressive name, roooooooooobert probably elicited cheers and applause wherever he went.",
