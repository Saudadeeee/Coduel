  "description": "Congratulations! You’ve just inherited a treasure map from a\nlong deceased ancestor who just happened to be a pirate. With\nvisions of gold doubloons and jeweled cutlasses dancing in your\nhead you carefully unfold the map. However instead of the\nstandard picture map with a large X where the treasure is, this\nmap is simply a list of instructions on where to start digging.\nThe first instruction is the starting location, given as two\nintegers x y giving the starting point’s\nlatitude and longitude. After this are instructions like N 7 or\nSW 6 which specify to walk 7 feet north or 6 feet southwest.\nAfter following all of these instructions you will be located\nover the spot to start digging.",
