In this problem, your program should read two whole numbers
(also called integers) from the input, and print out their
sum.

As a refresher, here are some ways to read two numbers from
standard input in a few different languages:

## Input
The input contains one line, which has two integers a and b , separated by a single space. The
bounds on these values are 0 ≤
a, b ≤ 1 000 000 .

## Output
Output the sum of the two integers, a + b .

### Sample 1
**Input**
```text
3 4
```
**Output**
```text
7
```

### Sample 2
**Input**
```text
987 23
```
**Output**
```text
1010
```
