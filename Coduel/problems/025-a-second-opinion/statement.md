Write a program that, given a duration in seconds as input,
outputs the same duration as hours, minutes, and seconds.

Hint: use integer division ( // )
and remainder ( % ).

## Input
One line containing the integer s , the number of seconds that should
be rewritten, where 0 ≤ s
≤ 1 000 000 .

## Output
One line containing three integers, the number of hours, the
number of minutes, and the number of seconds separated by a
space, a colon, and another space.

### Sample 1
**Input**
```text
1000
```
**Output**
```text
0 : 16 : 40
```

### Sample 2
**Input**
```text
80000
```
**Output**
```text
22 : 13 : 20
```
