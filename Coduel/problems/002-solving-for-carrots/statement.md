You will be given the number of contestants in a
    hypothetical contest, the number of huffle-puff problems that
    people solved in the contest and a description of each
    contestant. Now, find the number of carrots that will be handed
    out during the contest.

## Input
Input starts with two integers $1 \le N, P \le 1\, 000$ on a single
    line, denoting the number of contestants in the contest and the
    number of huffle-puff problems solved in total. Then follow $N$ lines, each consisting
    of a single non-empty line in which the contestant describes
    him or herself. You may assume that the contestants are good at
    describing themselves, in a way such that an arbitrary
    5-year-old with hearing problems could understand it.

## Output
Output should consist of a single integer: the number of
    carrots that will be handed out during the contest.
