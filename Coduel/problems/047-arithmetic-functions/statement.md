Your task is to implement the following functions in
C++:

First, download the files arithmeticfunctions.h and arithmeticfunctions.cpp and put them in the
same directory. You should implement the functions in the arithmeticfunctions.cpp file and
submit only that file .

It is guaranteed that the results of x - y and x^3 always fit in an int .

## Testing
The arithmeticfunctions.h file
includes a main function that tests your program on some
example cases. For further testing, you can modify that
file.
