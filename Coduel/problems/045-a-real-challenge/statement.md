Old MacDonald had a farm, and on that farm she had a
square-shaped pasture, and on that pasture she had a cow that
was prone to escape. So now Old MacDonald wants to set up a
fence around the pasture. Given the area of the pasture, how
long a fence does Old MacDonald need to buy?

## Input
The input consists of a single integer a ( 1
≤ a ≤ 10^18 ), the area in square meters of Old
MacDonald’s pasture.

## Output
Output the total length of fence needed for the pasture, in
meters. The length should be accurate to an absolute or
relative error of at most 10^-6 .
