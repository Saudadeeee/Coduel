  "description": "The current policy of the government can be represented by a\npoint in the plane. A voter\u2019s ideal policy would also be\nrepresented by a point in the plane. The voter\u2019s unhappiness\nwith the current policy is measured by the distance between\nthese two points. Many different distance metrics may be used,\nbut we will use squared Euclidean distance here.",
