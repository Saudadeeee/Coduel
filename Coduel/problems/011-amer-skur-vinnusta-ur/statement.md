You have recently begun your job as a civil engineer, or
“byggingarverkfræðingur” in Icelandic.

You spend most of your day designing road systems, but since
you are in the United States of America, everything is measured
in football fields.

You have decided to write a program to convert the
measurements from football fields to kilometers.

You may assume 1 football field is 0.09144 kilometers.

## Input
The first line of the input contains one integer n ( 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 ), the length of
the road in football fields.

## Output
The output should contain a single number on a single line,
the length of the road in kilometers. The answer is considered
correct if it has an absolute error less than 10^-5 .

## Scoring
### Sample 1
**Input**
```text
1
```
**Output**
```text
0.09144
```

### Sample 2
**Input**
```text
3
```
**Output**
```text
0.27432
```

### Sample 3
**Input**
```text
1337
```
**Output**
```text
122.25527999999998
```
