  "description": "A palindrome is a sequence of two or more characters that\nreads the same both forward and backward. Palindromes can\nappear inside a longer text, such as \u201cHappy days are here\nagain.\u201d in which \u201cpp\u201d, \u201cehe\u201d and \u201cere\u201d are some of the\npalindromes (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case). An\nanti-palindrome is a sequence of two or more characters in\nwhich there are no palindromes. You are given text that may\ncontain, or itself form, a palindrome. Your task is to\ndetermine if there are any palindromes in the text, in which\ncase declare \"Palindrome\", or if there are none, declare\n\"Anti-palindrome\". The text may contain spaces, as well as\nalphabetic and other non-alphabetic characters. All\nnon-alphabetic characters should be ignored, and uppercase and\nlowercase letters are considered the same when detecting\npalindromes.",
