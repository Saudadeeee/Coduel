Bergur is a very good programmer and has extensive
knowledge of most of the world’s programming languages. When
Bergur programs he never makes any mistakes and thus never has
to change what he has written. He however has the bad habit of
writing all of his code on a single line. There is one
programming language that only Bergur can handle, no other
programmer has attained the understanding required to make use
of it. This programming language was naturally designed by
Bergur himself.

Now all the world’s programmers are trying to figure out how
you program in BergMál, so they have worked together to put a
keylogger on Bergur’s computer. The keylogger then sends back
what keys Bergur presses and in what order. Can you take the
info that the keylogger sent and rewrite Bergur’s code in
BergMál?

## Input
A single line with the info that the keylogger sent. The
keylogger sends at least one character and at most 1 000 characters.

## Output
Output Bergur’s code.

## Scoring
