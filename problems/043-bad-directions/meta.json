You are currently being followed by the empire and\nmust calculate the jump to hyperspace. Your incompetent droid\nco-pilot failed to download the correct decryption program back\non the base. Thus, in order to get the proper hyperspace\ncoordinates, you must write a program to decrypt the hyperspace\ndistance you will travel.",
