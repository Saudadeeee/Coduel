  "description": "As a GPS hobbyist, you are interested in looking at how a\ndatabase of altitude recordings will change to account for sea\nlevel rise. For your projections, you will assume that between\nnow and 2050 , the sea\nlevel will rise by 30 centimeters. Your input will be a single altitude entry from a\ndatabase of geolocations (given in meters). You need to output\nwhat that altitude will be in 2050 , modified by your sea level\nrise projection.",
