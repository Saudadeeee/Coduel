You are given a circumference n and want to find a right-angled
triangle with integer side lengths that has a right angle and
this circumference. No side can have length 0 , nor a negative length.

## Input
The first and only line of input contains a positive integer n â‰¤ 10^4 .

## Output
Print three positive integers a, b, c separated by spaces. Here a, b should be the
lengths of the shorter sides and c the length of the hypotenuse. The
sum of the numbers must be n and the triangle must form a right
angle. If no solution exists, print three zeros instead.
