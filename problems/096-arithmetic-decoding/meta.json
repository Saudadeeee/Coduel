  "description": "Arithmetic coding is a method to represent a message as a\nreal number x such that 0 \u2264 x < 1 . We will\nassume that the message consists only of uppercase \u2018A\u2019s and\n\u2018B\u2019s. The two letters have associated probabilities p_ A and p_ B = 1 - p_ A such that 0 < p_ A < 1 .",
