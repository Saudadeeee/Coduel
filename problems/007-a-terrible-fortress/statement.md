Blaze Rod, Minecraft Wiki

As Steve, Alex, and Kai enter the nether, they wander for
what feels like days before finally discovering their goal; a
large, imposing fortress looms before them. As they begin to
walk the twisting hallways of the fortress, they turn a corner
and see a long, straight hallway full of blazes, large floating
fiery creatures ready to attack. Luckily, they haven’t been
spotted yet, so the three decide to count how many blazes are
in the hallway before deciding whether to fight or retreat.

Given a list of blaze counts describing the hallway, print
the total number of blazes that are present.

## Input
The first line of input contains an integer 1≤ n ≤ 1000 , the length of the
hallway. Each of the next n lines contains an integer, b , describing the number
of blazes in that section of hallway.

## Output
Output a single integer, T , the total number of blazes across
all sections of hallway. It is guaranteed that T won’t exceed 10^9 .
