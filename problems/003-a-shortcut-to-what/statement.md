Write a program that reads an integer n from the input. The program should
add five to n , then
triple the value and finally subtract ten. You are welcome to
simplify the formula if you can, as long as the program gives
the correct results.

## Input
Input consists of one line containing one integer n , where -1 000 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 .

## Output
Output consists of one line containing one integer, the
value computed from n as
described above.
