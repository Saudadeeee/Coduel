  "description": "The year 2016 is an important year for Forritunarkeppni\nFramhaldssk\u00f3lanna. For the first time ever the contest will be\nheld in two locations! But now it is the year 3016 and the\ncontest is held all over the country, not just in Reykjav\u00edk or\nAkureyri. The contestants no longer go to the contest, the\ncontest comes to them. The planning committee is having some\ntrouble the shirt distribution as a result. There are thousands\nof contestants, tens of thousands even, and the contest is too\nsoon for it to be possible to go over it all by hand. In the\nyear 3016 people are so used to computers programming for them,\naside from the occasional competitive programmer, that they\nhave completely forgotten how to program and have no idea how\nto solve this issue.",
