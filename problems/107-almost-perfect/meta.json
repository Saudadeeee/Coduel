  "description": "A positive integer p is called a perfect number if all the\nproper divisors of p sum\nto p exactly. Integer d is a proper divisor of p if 1 \u2264 d \u2264 p-1 and p is evenly divisible by d . For example, the\nnumber 28 is a perfect\nnumber, since its proper divisors (which are 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 and 14 ) add up to 28 .",
