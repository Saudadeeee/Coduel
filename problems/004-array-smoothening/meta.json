  "description": "You\u2019ve just finished writing a random array generator for\nyour competitive programming practical examination\nproblem. However, when you tested it, you noticed that the\ndistribution is skewed; some values may appear much more times\nthan the other values. You wanted to smoothen the distribution,\nbut you don\u2019t want to modify your generator anymore. Thus, you\ndecide to remove exactly K elements from the array, such that\nthe maximum occurrence of a value is minimized. Now, given an\narray A of size N , determine the minimum\npossible maximum occurrence of a value from the array after you\nremove exactly K elements from it.",
